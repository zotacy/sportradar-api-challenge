 > combine data form nhl apis to create csv files

 Build an ETL pipeline based on NHL APIs. The separation of concerns, number of functions, and general approach is entirely up to you. The following functionality is required.

* **Team Pipeline** - Provide a team id and season year which outputs a CSV file. The CSV should include the following:
  * Team ID
  * Team Name
  * Team Venue Name
  * Games Played
  * Wins
  * Losses
  * Points
  * Goals Per Game
  * Game Date of First Game of Season
  * Opponent Name in First Game of Season
* **Player Pipeline** - Provide a player id and season year which outputs a CSV file. The CSV should include the following:
  * Player ID
  * Player Name
  * Current Team
  * Player Age
  * Player Number
  * Player Position
  * If the player is a rookie
  * Assists
  * Goals
  * Games
  * Hits
  * Points

This exercise is in-lieu of a traditional whiteboard/algorithm style type interview. Not only will this exercise serve as our initial evaluation of your development skills, it will also be a center-piece to further conversations we will have with you. We respect your time and the fact that you have a life and possibly a day-job, so put in as much time as you feel will be a fair representation of your skills.  However, this exercise is purposefully open ended and can be an opportunity for you to show off. Hopefully this is something you can have fun with.

While the approach you take to meeting the above objectives is up to you, here are a couple of things we will expect:

* There should be a basic README included.
* There should be tests.
* We should be able to run this locally (provide instructions if need be).

Please do not create a pull-request against this repository; you should create your own project/repository.  Also--while not required--it would be nice to have access to your commit history (i.e. don't squash) through github. However if you are not comfortable with this for any reason, submitting a zip file with the contents of the project is acceptable as well.

Below you will find complete documentation to a public NHL API. You will not need the majority of these endpoints, they are provided for completeness.

### <a name="game"></a>Game
`GET https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ID/feed/live` Returns all data about
a specified game id including play data with on-ice coordinates and post-game
details like first, second and third stars and any details about shootouts.  The
data returned is simply too large at often over 30k lines and is best explored
with a JSON viewer.

`GET https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ID/boxscore` Returns far less detail
than `feed/live` and is much more suitable for post-game details including goals,
shots, PIMs, blocked, takeaways, giveaways and hits.

`GET https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ID/linescore` Even fewer details than
boxscore. Has goals, shots on goal, powerplay and goalie pulled status, number of 
skaters and shootout information if applicable

`GET http://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ID/content` Complex endpoint returning
multiple types of media relating to the game including videos of shots, goals and saves.

`GET https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/ID/feed/live/diffPatch?startTimecode=yyyymmdd_hhmmss`
Returns updates (like new play events, updated stats for boxscore, etc.) for the specified game ID
since the given startTimecode. If the startTimecode param is missing, returns an empty array.

#### <a name="game-ids">Game IDs
The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7).


#### <a name="game-types">Game Types

`GET https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/gameTypes`

    "name": "Stanley Cup",
    "shortName": "The Cup",
    "description": "History: The Stanley Cup, the oldest trophy competed for by professional athletes in North America, was donated by Frederick Arthur, Lord Stanley of Preston and son of the Earl of Derby, in 1893. Lord Stanley purchased the trophy for 10 guineas ($50 at that time) for presentation to the amateur hockey champions of Canada. Since 1906, when Canadian teams began to pay their players openly, the Stanley Cup has been the symbol of professional hockey supremacy. It has been contested only by NHL teams since 1926-27 and has been under the exclusive control of the NHL since 1947.",
    "recipientType": "Team",
    "history": "It all started on March 18, 1892, at a dinner of the Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association. Lord Kilcoursie, a player on the Ottawa Rebels hockey club from Government House, delivered the following message on behalf of Lord Stanley, the Earl of Preston and Governor General of Canada  -- &quot;I have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion (of Canada).  There does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present, and considering the general interest which matches now elicit, and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized, I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team.&quot; --  Shortly thereafter, Lord Stanley purchased a silver cup measuring 7.5 inches high by 11.5 inches across for the sum of 10 guineas (approximately $50); appointed two Ottawa gentlemen, Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip D. Ross, as trustees of that cup.  The first winner of the Stanley Cup was the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) hockey club, champions of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada for 1893. Ironically, Lord Stanley never witnessed a championship game nor attended a presentation of his trophy, having returned to his native England in the midst of the 1893 season. Nevertheless, the quest for his trophy has become one of the worlds most prestigious sporting competitions.",
